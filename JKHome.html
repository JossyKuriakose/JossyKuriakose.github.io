                <p>I go biking in the summer. I find this activity to be incredibly fun and challenging. I ride on my
                    local trails a lot. I even went to a mountain to go mountain biking. I would love to go mountain
                    biking in many national parks to get cover a lot of distance. I watched videos of people mountain
                    biking in desert. That is something that on my bucket list; mountain biking in an Arizona or New
                    Mexico desert. </p>

                <p>Traveling is something that I want to do more often. If things go according to plan, I would like to
                    visit one international location and one domestic location every year. I want to visit every
                    continent before I die. I also would like to travel to all 50 states.</p>
